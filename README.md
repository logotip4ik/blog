Still under development, but feel free to read and break everything üòÅ. Also one of main challenges is to use as little as possible of classes selectors, exception is code highlighting and that's why [sakura](https://github.com/oxalorg/sakura) (classless CSS framework / theme) was choosen

## Build with

- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) - as written on the website "Next Generation Frontend Tooling", in simpler words - bundler, but not quite

- [Animejs](https://animejs.com) - used for animations, could use gsap, but i wanted to build the blog simple and small. Bundlephobia says that gsap is 3.8 times larger then animejs.

- [OGL](https://github.com/oframe/ogl) - background, smaller that threejs

- [Sakura](https://github.com/oxalorg/sakura) - instead of building styles from ground up, used this and added some minor changes to specific areas

- [shiki](https://shiki.matsu.io) - used for syntax highlighting in markdown
