# Blog

Still under development, but feel free to read and break everything 😁

> Any pull requests or issues is appreciated

## Build with

- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) - as written on the website "Next Generation Frontend Tooling", in simpler words - bundler, but not quite

- [Popmotion](https://popmotion.io) - used for animations, could use gsap, but i wanted to build the blog simple and small. Bundlephobia says that gsap is 2.6 times larger then popmotion. Animejs was also as option, but last commit was done 2 years ago

- [OGL](https://github.com/oframe/ogl) - background, smaller that threejs

- [Sakura.css](https://github.com/oxalorg/sakura) - instead of building styles from ground up, used this and added some minor changes to specific areas

- [shiki](https://shiki.matsu.io) - used for syntax highlighting in markdown
