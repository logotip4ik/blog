# Why even Vim ?

Recently I started a job...

In the past, I was a heavy [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) user. That was a nice
experience. I loved VSCode. It's fast, stable, pretty, configurable, and easily extendable.
It doesn't require you to do anything to get started. Need a Vue support? `Ctrl+Shift+X` type
`vue` and the first plugin would probably be an official and excellent tool. Same with React,
GraphQL, Deno, you name it. VSCode has a large community and lots of issues closed and open,
so if you encounter a problem it shouldn't take a while to find something useful or right away
a fix.

If there wasn't a **necessity**, I wouldn't switch from VSCode.

## vim is hard...

Take on the other hand - _Vim_. To get started you **must** learn at least how to exit it. Then
movements, replacements, searching, and so on... After that, you will need to _âœ¨configureâœ¨_ your
setup to at least enable some syntax highlighting. You won't get any autocompletion, highlighting,
LSP, hints, file-tree, or icons out of the box. That will also require some plugins installed...
Probably I've spent **more** time configuring Vim, than VSCode, despite using VSCode for 5+ years(?)
and 4-5 months Vim. And sometimes strange things happen to Vim, some plugin stops working after an
update or something else _just_ doesn't work. You will need to take a deep dive into stackoverflow,
neovim issues, or some blog posts from 2004.

## but there is a catch to it

I would say that Vim is _addictive_, maybe not the Vim itself, but it's movements, it's quickness and
lightness. After you learn some even basic movements and get used to them, it becomes difficult to
use normal text editing tools (like VSCode). Almost every move or action is one key away from your
fingers. There is no need to shift your hands to arrows or mouse every now and then. Start-up or even
code actions become faster. With Vim **you** become faster. But, is the time spent configuring, getting
used to keys, and fixing issues worth all of it? I don't know... I always wanted to learn it, and I knew
that sometime in the future it would happen. But every time I tried, I switched soon back to VSCode,
because I didn't see the value of using it (yes, skill issue).

Now I'm a happy [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) user, with [custom config](https://gist.github.com/logotip4ik/5e7796a48ef104e5cb2452647f67d689).
I would probably never use VSCode again (maybe [Zed](https://zed.dev/) ?). Use whatever works for
you, never stop learning and writing code. Vim wouldn't make you a better developer.

Hope to get back here soon, bye ðŸ‘‹.
